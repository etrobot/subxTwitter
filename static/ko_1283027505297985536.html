<p>Those pages contained months of self-reflection, ideas &amp; dreams.  </p>
<p>I should be sad and yet, somehow, it feels right.  </p>
<p>The loss provided an unexpected opportunity to practice the art of letting go.  </p>
<p>There’s something special about losing an item meant to record your thoughts. It almost becomes a memento mori:</p>
<p>All that is acquired will be lost
What rises will fall
Where there is meeting
there will be separation
What is born will surely die</p>
<p>I’ve also been struggling to journal the past few weeks.  </p>
<p>Losing my notebook gave me a new appreciation for the act of journaling and the insights stored in those notebooks.  </p>
<p>Overall I feel a renewed sense of excitement about daily journaling.  </p>
<p>(and as this notebook was discontinued I’m on the hunt for good brands! ideally spiral bound, unlined)</p>

If nothing but to share an important takeaway for other founders, Figma is not why InVision failed.  </p>
<p>Simply, InVision failed because they stopped listening to customers.  </p>
<p>Figma built tools InVision customers had been asking for for years. IN had become so obsessed with winning against Adobe and Sketch, and trying to own the end-to-end design system on a much too aggressive timeline that it lost sight of solving for the customer on what they needed at that moment in time, not years from now.  </p>
<p>Understandably, in a category where Designers are fickle and switch tools easily, IN had every right to be paranoid about the incumbents. Their vision was incredibly ambitious, but that ambition caused a lack of focus on their core product.  </p>
<p>To be clear, IN had an immense love for their customers and the design community. They championed a movement that gave designers a voice and seat at the table. They didn’t just sell software but a purpose. They created a category!  </p>
<p>But while IN focused on Adobe, Figma focused on quietly building a better product, slowly. Figma had only raised $15m until 2018, and it took them 8 years to hit their first $1M in rev.  </p>
<p>I have incredible respect and love for InVision’s founders, team, and know first hand just how HARD building a company is for the long haul. I can only imagine the decisions they needed to make on a daily basis. I feel such great sadness for everyone involved.  </p>
<p>But while it’s really easy to point fingers at innovators dilemma (totally a fair point), my POV (which may reflect differently from others whom I respect)…figma’s entrance just exposed an internal weakness at InVision, that at which point when you’re already a $100m business, is really hard to course correct.</p>

1. Don’t try to grow 1000 followers in 10 days - much better to develop a few genuine connections with a small close-knit group of people that can all help each other<br />
2. Keep It Simple - short but meaningful tweets (tough one!)<br />
3. Share you personal learnings in the hope it helps someone else (meta advice!) - no need to sound authoritative on it, just aim to be helpful, and be open that you’re still learning🥦</p>
